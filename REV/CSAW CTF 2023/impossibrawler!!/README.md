In this game, if you want to get flag you have to beat all the enemies. And of course, I cant make any damege on them.

I noticed file exe icon and when open the file I see the a text `Godot`. Now Iam know I need [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and [Godot Re Tool](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp) which tool help us extract resources for further inspection.


In godot I will recover pck file. And I get the whole list of assets displayed and can export all the assets to a folder
