In IDA, at mainCRtStartup fuction I see a anti-debug boot section and a self-modifying code:

```
        v4 = main;
        do
        {
          *(_BYTE *)v4 ^= 0x5Cu;
          v4 = (int (__cdecl *)(int, const char **, const char **))((char *)v4 + 1);
        }
        while ( (int)v4 <= (int)sub_401791 );
```

when I pointer into `main` it show me a confusing code and looks like it's missing

I will analysis it on `x32dbg`, at least I known main fuction address `401620`

$ Dynamic Analysis

When start debugging you shouldn't set breakpoint at main fuction address, you should set it at `Entrypoint` cuz it very likely that program was previously infected with anti-debug.

In x32/64 it is `OptionalHeader/AddressOÃˆntryPoint`.

At entrypoint the program about to jump to `408904` address. I setted breakpoint at this current address is `4010f9` and step into `408904`

After go into 408904 I will set breakpoint and step into each address to analysis flow of the program

At here the program is compare eax with 3E8 if `eax` greater, the program will jump to `408922`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe80db87-5496-4784-a799-ff00d86b3c62)

and if it jump to 408922 maybe the program will be break you can see detail in image above. The text `sp-analysis failed` could be a sign that this section is infected with anti-debugg. So i will edit `ZF` (Zeroflag) from 0 to 1 mean that It's always a true condition. And continue step.
